random5
=======

A simple XBMC/Kodi add-on that plays 5 (or how ever many you define in the add-on's settings) random episodes from a 
chosen TV show. Easy way to decide what to watch when falling asleep.

### Settings ###
* Number of playlist items - Determines the amount of episodes added to the playlist.
* Watched episodes only - Determines if only watched items should be added to the playlist.
* Sequential order - If enabled, the first episode is randomly chosen and the others follow in order.
* Automatically start playback - If enabled, playback of the playlist is automatically started otherwise the playlist
is simply shown.
