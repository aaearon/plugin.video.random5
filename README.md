random5
=======

A simple XBMC add-on that plays 5 (or how ever many you define in the add-on's settings) random episodes from a chosen TV show. Easy way to decide what to watch when falling asleep.

Allows you to specify watched episodes only as episodes that should be randomly selected and allows you to fill with unwatched episodes incase there are not enough watched ones to fill the playlist.
